If you would like to proceed, you can download the latest `x64` package [here](https://github.com/jeromemanzano/WebBrowser/releases/latest). This is a self-contained single file Windows application so you don't need to install anything else. After downloading `WebBrowser.WPF.exe` file, click it to run. It will take a while on first attempt but subsequent run should be faster.
